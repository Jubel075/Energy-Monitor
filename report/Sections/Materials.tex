\subsection{Arduino Micro-controller}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Microcontroller: The heart of the project. It processes the data received from sensors, performs calculations, and controls other components.
    \item Digital and Analog Pins: These pins are used to connect sensors and actuators. Digital pins provide high or low signals, while analog pins can read varying voltage levels.
    \item Power Supply: The board can be powered by a USB cable or an external power supply.
    \item Serial Communication: The board can communicate with a computer or other devices using a serial connection.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{YHDC Current Transformer SCT-013-000}
    \input{Graphics/CT-sensor}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Non-invasive Measurement: It measures the current flowing through a wire without physically breaking the circuit.
    \item Magnetic Induction: It works based on the principle of electromagnetic induction.
    \item Output Signal: It produces a small AC voltage proportional to the current flowing through the wire.
    \item Safety: It allows for safe measurement of high currents without the risk of electric shock.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Liquid Crystal Display}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Display: It displays information like voltage, current, power consumption, and other relevant data.
    \item Backlight: It provides illumination for better visibility.
    \item Interface: It connects to the Arduino board through digital pins to receive and display data. 
    \item Types: There are various types of LCDs, including character LCDs and graphic LCDs. \cite{OpenEnergyMonitor}
\end{itemize} 


\subsection{ Other Potential Components:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Voltage Sensor: Measures the voltage entering the circuit.
    \item Temperature Sensor: Monitors the temperature of the system or environment.
    \item Power Supply: Provides the necessary power for the Arduino and other components.
    \item Resistors: Used to limit current and divide voltage.
    \item Capacitors: Used to filter noise and store energy.
\end{itemize}
