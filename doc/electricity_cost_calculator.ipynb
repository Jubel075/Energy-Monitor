    "# Household Electricity Cost Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook calculates the total cost of electricity for household users in Suriname. The calculation is based on various factors, such as:\n",
    "- Baseline rate\n",
    "- Consumption\n",
    "- Subsidy\n",
    "- Feed-in energy from solar power\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "1. **Baseline rate**: This is a fixed monthly charge based on the connection type (1-phase, 2-phase, or 3-phase).\n",
    "2. **Consumption**: The user's monthly electricity consumption in kWh, which is billed according to tiered rates.\n",
    "3. **Subsidy**: A subsidy is applied based on the user's consumption, depending on the amount of electricity used.\n",
    "4. **Feed-in**: The energy fed back into the grid from solar power, which can be deducted from the total cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Expressions Used in the Electricity Cost Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consumption Rate Calculation (Verbruikstarief):**  \n",
    "   $$ V_{\\text{tarief}} = \\sum_{i} \\left( (\\text{schijf}_1 - \\text{schijf}_0) \\times \\text{tarief} \\right) \\quad \\text{if} \\quad \\text{verbruik} > \\text{schijf}_1 $$  \n",
    "   Otherwise:  \n",
    "   $$ V_{\\text{tarief}} = (\\text{verbruik} - \\text{schijf}_0) \\times \\text{tarief} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subsidy Calculation:**  \n",
    "   $$ \\text{subsidie} = \\sum_{i} \\left( \\text{subsidiebedrag} \\quad \\text{if} \\quad \\text{verbruik} \\in \\text{verbruiksdeel} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cosphi Penalty:**  \n",
    "   $$ P_{\\text{cosphi}} = \\text{verbruik} \\times \\text{cosphi}_{\\text{penalty\\_rate}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Backfeeding Credit Calculation (Teruglevering):**  \n",
    "   $$ T_{\\text{teruglevering}} = \\text{teruglevering} \\times \\text{teruglevertarief} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Total Cost Calculation:**  \n",
    "   $$ T_{\\text{totale}} = \\text{basistarief} + \\text{verbruikstarief} - \\text{subsidie} + P_{\\text{cosphi}} - T_{\\text{teruglevering}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Logic:\n",
    "1. The user selects their connection type.\n",
    "2. The user enters their monthly consumption.\n",
    "3. The user enters the amount of energy fed back into the grid (if any).\n",
    "4. The program calculates the total cost based on these inputs, considering tiered consumption rates, subsidy, and feed-in energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's start with the code that implements these calculations."
